# Zero Trust Governance Kit
A modular, cloud-agnostic framework to implement fine-grained data access controls, accelerate compliance, and scale responsible AI adoption across public and private sector environments.

---

## 🔒 Overview
The **Zero Trust Governance Kit** provides policy templates, Terraform modules, and API integration blueprints for organizations looking to rapidly deploy **attribute-based access controls (ABAC)** and meet regulatory frameworks like **HIPAA**, **FedRAMP**, and **FINRA**—without proprietary lock-in.

This project is built to empower under-resourced IT/security teams across **healthcare**, **research**, and **municipal sectors** to adopt secure-by-default principles and modernize their data governance without costly vendor dependencies.

## ⚙️ Features
- ✅ **ABAC Policy Libraries** for AWS IAM, Azure RBAC, and GCP IAM
- 🛠 **Terraform Modules** to provision cross-cloud, metadata-driven permissions
- 📦 **Reference Architectures** for on-prem and hybrid deployment scenarios
- 🧾 **Compliance Blueprints**: Automated mappings to HIPAA, SOC 2, and FedRAMP controls
- 📊 **Security Dashboards**: Sample templates for monitoring identity-based access patterns

---

## 🧪 Use Cases
- Secure access to patient records across multi-cloud data lakes (HIPAA)
- Fine-grained access control for research environments with sensitive IP
- Cross-org data sharing in federated AI workloads
- Internal developer governance and audit trail automation
